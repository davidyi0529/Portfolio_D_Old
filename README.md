# Portfolio_D

<br />

> Project Portfolio_D is a project that allowed me to get my feet wet with **[HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/)** and **[BOOTSTRAP](https://getbootstrap.com/)**.
  I will go through some of the features and tools that helped me get started with my portfolio.

## Features

<br />
<br />

I would like to discuss some of the key features used for this project. The following tools below were mainly used without using any media queries.

- `HTML`
- `Bootstrap`

Since Bootstrap was able to provide a basic layout to get started, it was just a matter of research of putting the building blocks together.

<br />

>Bootstrap features utilized...

- `Navbar` - This component was used for the top and bottom bars.
- `Card` - Used in the main **About me** page and **Portfolio** page. Since this was mainly use in the body of the page, 
           there was a lot of trial and error on the spacings.
- `Grids`
- `Input group`
- `Forms`
- `Colors`

<br />

There are a lot of cool features that Bootstrap can provide and I can't wait to utilize it more in future projects.
